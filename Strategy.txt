Hi Pauline,

I was thinking that maybe we should devise a strategy wrt analyzing the missing data. 
We should focus on those features that show a **strong** correlation with the `Overall_Experience`, and have
a **large number** of missing values.

1. I think we should focus on the correlated features that are purple, and maybe green, if time permits.

2. Let's say features X and Y are correlated.
Then,
    df.groupby([X, Y])[X, Y].count().reset_index()
Will give us an indication of how the values are distributed.

3. Now, we need to identify the missing values.

df[df[X].isna()].groupby(Y)[Y].count()

Should give us the values for Y when X is null. 

Use the distribution on step #2 to imput values for X.

Of course, there's the case when both X and Y are null, and that should be treated further (or not).

4. Repeat step #3 for the Y feature.
